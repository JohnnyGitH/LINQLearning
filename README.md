Learning about LINQ

Hey, this is a simple console app that I am creating to help learn about LINQ.

## What is LINQ?

**LINQ** stands for **Language Integrated Query**.

It lets you **query data** (like filtering, sorting, and selecting) using **C# syntax**, instead of writing complex loops.

You can use LINQ to work with:

- Arrays
- Lists
- Databases
- XML
- Anything that supports `IEnumerable` or `IQueryable`

I am using the Alphabet , a Number list and a list of Products with Name / Category / Price properties to help learn to use LINQ

## To Run

Make sure you have .NET installed, open a terminal, navigate to the .sln file and type **dotnet run** - Test
